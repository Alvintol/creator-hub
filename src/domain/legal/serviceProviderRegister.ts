// The Service Provider Register the Privacy Policy refers to (sections 4, 9
// and 11; launch-scope.md section 7.2). Not an accepted policy, so it has no
// entry in policy_acceptances: it is a published list that changes whenever a
// provider does, and the Privacy Policy commits to adding a provider here
// before it processes personal information.
//
// Each provider row is a "Label: value; Label: value" line, which
// LegalPolicySections renders as a table -- so a value must never contain a
// semicolon. Locations are the ones verified for this deployment: Supabase
// project region us-west-2, Cloud Run region us-central1
// (docs/launch-implementation-checklist.md, Sprint 3).
